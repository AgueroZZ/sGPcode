## Data

- **Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5**: Datasets are automatically accessed or downloaded in the R scripts.

- **Section 4.4**: The dataset is downloaded from https://www.sidc.be/silso/.

## Scripts

The examples in the main paper are replicated in the following scripts. Specific points to pay attention to:
1. In each example, please make sure the working directory is correctly specified.
2. All the required R packages will be loaded in the R script, please make sure they are installed in the system before proceed.

The results in the paper are reproduced by compiling each of the R script (please make sure each cpp file is compiled before running the R script in the corresponding folder).
